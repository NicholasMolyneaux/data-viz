The data presented on this website comes from two alternative sources.
The first is simulated data and the second is empirical data.

###Emprical data
For several months in 2013 the two pedestrian underpasses of the train station in Lausanne (Switzerland) were equiped 
with a tracking system used to record the motions of pedestrians. This system, which respected the privacy of the users,
tracked the pedestrians with a very high resolution of 100 milliseconds. This produced a large amount of data which has
proven very valuable for exploratory analysis of pedestrian dynamics during peak hours. 

###Simulated data
Multiple scientific projects have relied on the empirical data for calibration purposes. Two PhD theses have been published
using the tracking data and another one is currently taking place:

Nikolić, M. (2017). Data-driven fundamental models for pedestrian movements (Doctoral dissertation, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne).

Hänseler, F. S. (2016). Modeling and estimation of pedestrian flows in train stations (Doctoral dissertation, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne).

The current ongoing research covers control and management strategies for pedestrians. The objective is to transpose the
successful concepts used in road traffic like ramp metering, signalized intersections or variable speed limits to the pedestrian
world. For further reading regarding this topic, please refer to the following:

### TRANS-FORM
A joint european project between multiple academic and industrial partners which uses the microscopic pedestrian simulator
as part of the multi-level modelling approach. For more details on the project, please visit: http://www.trans-form-project.org/
This visualization tool is used for the project in order to gain insight into the pedestrian motions taking place at the
main station of Den Haag (Netherlands).
